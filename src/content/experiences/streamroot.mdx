Led development on our company dashboard used both internally and externally to manage accounts and product configurations as well as view analytics for our streaming technology which powered millions of video sessions a day. Built primarily with **TypeScript**, **React** and **Node.js**.

Coordinated with other team leads to organize and carry out cross-team projects. Collaborated with the product team to mock up UIs in **Figma** and define specifications.

Set up Continuous Integration to build **Docker** images for my project that could then be deployed with **Kubernetes** tooling (created by dev-ops team) on **GCP** infrastructure.

Maintained and updated marketing site in **WordPress**.
