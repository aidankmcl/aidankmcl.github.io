At Olin, engineering work is infused with human-centered design and mindfulness around social impact. Nearly all classes encourage hands-on learning via team projects where students learn to collaborate effectively and deliver prototypes ranging from sketch models to fully developed products.

In addition to general engineering with a concentration in computer science, my humanities capstone was exploring the psychology of interaction design.
