Led development of a talent search platform for discovering underrepresented creators, built using a combination of **React**, **Node.js**, and **Firebase**.

Managed contractors across the world, facilitating communication and code review as well as aiding with development and planning of tasks.

Worked with team to plan migration from **Firestore** to **PostgreSQL** (and generally leaving **Firebase**), including ways to flexibly address technical debt along the way.
