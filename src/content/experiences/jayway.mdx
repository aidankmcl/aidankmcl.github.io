Worked on a 3D planner for visualizing combinations of furniture for the home in countries all around the world using **Babylonjs**, **React** and **Redux**.

Coordinated with an interagency data science team that interfaced with all the different planner projects to improve conversions using behavioral data.

Worked on a team of three to release a brand new range of products on the planner and served as a liaison to our vendor for verifying 3D models. Used **Blender** to clean up / modify geometries of models handed off by vendors.

Gave a talk on **Redux Sagas** as part of Jayway's regular knowledge sharing day.
