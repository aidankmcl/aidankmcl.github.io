My brother and I worked on this game after watching "The 100," a series about humans re-colonizing Earth after a nuclear apocalypse. The concept is that you choose what tasks people are allocated to over a day and balance resources with defending your settlement and scouting out more of the area. The bulk of the interface lies in task allocation and the right side is essentially a journal of each day's events that updates each time you wrap up your daily allocations.

The cubes above are the beginnings of rendering a town that reflects your current population. Some thoughts on future work:

- Create basic models in Blender for settlement buildings as well as natural resources in the area.
- Add system for managing interactions with newly discovered settlements, maybe with protocols for engagement chosen at time of task allocation (e.g. try to befriend vs attack).
- I think this game would be a good candidate for using an LLM as a procedural dungeon master who could develop the lore of the world as you progress.
- Prettier UI :)
