For this tech demo I wanted to implement a pipeline from Blender to Unity that I would be able to rely on for future game development. The Rigify extension set up a good foundation that I could then tweak, after that I was more focused on how to organize animations and format them for Unity. I still have a lot to learn in this realm but it was a good way to dip my toes and expand my toolbox!

Here is a video of the model walking around in Unity with a little narration:

I also put together a quick video of the Monkey race walking to "Class Historian" by BRONCHO
