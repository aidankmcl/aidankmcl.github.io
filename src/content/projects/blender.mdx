I've been following tutorials for a handful of years and have made some scenes and models, both for game projects as well as standalone renders.

<Image src={theseus} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="Bust of Theseus in the sand" />
**Brain of Theseus**: A friend told me about a thought experiment inspired by the Ship of Theseus paradox, coming from the legend of Athenians maintaining Theseus' ship over generations after he escaped the minotaur - replacing parts as they decay. The original paradox asks "If every piece of the ship is eventually replaced, is that still Theseus' ship?" The "Brain of Theseus" flavor asks "if we could do the same with our brains using synthetic brain to incrementally replace the initial brain, is the resulting consciousness still you?" At what point is it no longer you? This render uses sand to represent the granular physical material our consciousness arises from.

While I was making this, I had "Lump" by The Presidents of the United States of America stuck in my head, so I made a rough rig and made this video:
<Video src={"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MT-5k55mbyGf0AlQUSYyXbaksywqzN01/preview"} alt={`Theseus head singing "Lump"`} />
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={tennisWorld} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="Tennis ball world with a road running along the rubber seam." />
For this scene I was thinking about mixing geometries from different contexts and liked this idea of shrinking the world to the size of a tennis ball.
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={infinityPool} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="A round hole in the floor going through many levels, with diving boards facing each other." />
**Infinity Pool**: Inspired by Backrooms and the popularity of liminal and extradimensional spaces.
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={scrat} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="Scrat from Ice Age jumping through the clouds on Splat devices from Unruly Studios" />
Just for fun, a render of Scrat from Ice Age jumping across Splats in the clouds. These platforms are from Unruly Studios and students can run and jump on them to control games in their app, I made this while contracting with the company as a fullstack developer.

The artifacts on the Splats are from doing a fairly quick and dirty job cutting out geometry from a full CAD assembly file. I didn't model anything in the scene, instead focusing on composition and rigging / adding hair to the Scrat model I found online.
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={pattern} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="Using a pattern to imagine a futuristic power transfer system." />
**Nexus**: Using a pattern to imagine a futuristic power transfer system that routes energy between galaxies.
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={door} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="A portal to a new year and hopefully some new luck!" />

<Image src={husky} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="Dog tracks in the snow." />

<Image src={enchanted} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="A render of the first key door from Kingdom Hearts." />
**Enchanted**: A render of the first key door from Kingdom Hearts.
<hr class="m-b-8" />

<Image src={snow} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="An abandoned bunker found after a blizzard." />
**Fallout**: An abandoned bunker found after a blizzard. I've only played a little bit of Fallout 3 and 4 but have loved the lore, which inspired this. Update 2024: I thought the Fallout TV show was excellent!

<Image src={doorMaterial} class="w-full m-b-6" alt="A closeup on the procedural material used on the bunker door." />
