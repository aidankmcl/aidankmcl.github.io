          I joined the indico team halfway through my time at Olin College as the startup's first hire. During my two years there we went through the Techstars accelerator, raised a $3M round of seed funding and grew from 4 in a dorm room to around 12 employees in a downtown Boston office. It was a whirlwind of a first full-time development job and I learned an incredible amount!

          My primary responsibilities were working on the client dashboard and maintaining the marketing website. I worked a bit with D3 for creating visualizations including an app that processed Twitter data to give you an overview of your feed's sentiment.
