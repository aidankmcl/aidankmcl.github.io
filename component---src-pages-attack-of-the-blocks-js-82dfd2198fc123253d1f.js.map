I worked on a team of three and our goal was VR Tetris with an elemental spin where blocks interact with each other after being placed. In the end we ran out of time before digging into the elements but it was fun to try Tetris in a new medium! The video below shows the prototype interaction that I worked on during the hackathon.\n        </p>\n\n        <EmbedVideo title=\"3D Tetris in virtual reality\" link=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KeWh0NwnSKMIC6C959Y6CzBtk3pwfmGw/preview\" />\n      </div>\n    </ArticleLayout>\n  )\n};\n\nexport default AttackOfTheBlocks;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
